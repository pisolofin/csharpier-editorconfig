# csharpier-config

This is as non opinionated version of [csharpier](https://github.com/belav/csharpier) tool created to add EditorConfig file style guide,
allowing users to define and apply custom styling options.

I started implementing these options in a separate branch called [feature/brackets](https://github.com/pisolofin/csharpier-editorconfig/tree/feature/brackets).

**This is a work in progress project**

In this branch, I will set up the project with new references in the documentation, as well as handle the deployment and naming of the executable program.

All documentation that you find about csharpier is also valid for csharpier-config, you have only to change command like
All documentation you find about `CSharpier` is also valid for `CSharpier-Config`. You only need to adjust the commands accordingly.

- `dotnet csharpier` -> `dotnet csharpier-config`
- `dotnet-csharpier` -> `dotnet-csharpier-config`
